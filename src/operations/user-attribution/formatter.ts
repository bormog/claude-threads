 * - Empty / falsy / "unknown" / sanitizes-to-empty → `message` unchanged
 *   (never break or half-tag a message; system/control sends pass no username

/**
 * Whether a session should actually attribute its turns right now.

 * FORK DIVERGENCE — see FORK_NOTES.md. Upstream also requires
 * `participantCount > 1`, so a solo thread never carries a prefix. That guard
 * reads `session.sessionAllowedUsers.size`, a set which grows only via
 * `!invite` or another user reviving a paused session — while anyone the
 * platform's global allowlist accepts may write into a thread without ever
 * entering it (`isAuthorizedForSession`, src/session/authorization.ts). This
 * deployment has the whole team globally allowed and sharing threads without
 * `!invite`, so the count stays 1 forever and attribution would never fire.
 * The decision is therefore the config flag alone.
 *
 * `participantCount` is still accepted, and ignored, so all six call sites stay
 * byte-identical to upstream and a rebase conflicts in this file only.
 *
 * Kept as a pure predicate over primitives (not a `Session`) so it stays
 * trivially testable and introduces no import cycle into the session module.
